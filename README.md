# Regex-tutorial
In this tutorial it will explain how a specific expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does, SO THAT you can understand the search pattern that the regex defines.

## Summary

The featured regex in this tutorial is designed to match specific patterns within text. As we dive into its components, you'll begin to understand how it all functions.
